## Introduction
In this tutorial post, we are going to make RUNNING LIGHTS that can be used in different ways like store attractions or simply to beautify anything depends on your creativity and desired application. I made this tutorial post to share another ways of making electronic project not as usual using an arduino. The main components here are 7493 IC and 74154 IC. 7493 IC which is also known as binary counter, will provide a series of changes as pulses was received from the timer circuit while 74154 Demultiplexer will give corresponding output based on the given proper controlled input signal.

#### Difficulty

‚ô¶ Intermediate

#### Tutorial Contents
Now, I'm going to teach you how to make our RUNNING LIGHTS Circuit using a software called [Proteus](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus_Design_Suite). 

## Part I. Schematic Diagram

‚ù∂ Open the Proteus Software

‚ù∏ Find and select all the needed Components
>The picture below only shows the main components since the other components are very easy to find by just typing their specific name like resistors, capacitor and LEDs.

#### All Proteus Components needed

 ‚ùπ Assembling the components
 ###  <center>  First Stage </center>

Actually, The circuit of the project has 3 major stages or parts. The first one is the picture below which is the NE555 area which serves as the timer of the circuit produces pulses depends upon the value combination of resistors.

![11.PNG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmaayQ934fr82x14JKysQLgiBQYAoxzKjUrHRvZf5qrN4i/11.PNG) 
>The purple circle is the Potentiometer which can be adjusted to produce a certain speed of the  frequency. As the resistance increases, the frequency per seconds will becomes slower or smaller while the red arrow represents for the output of this stage.

 ###  <center>  Second Stage </center>
![12.PNG](https://steemitimages.com/DQmSAagQM7UspQn3ZtUpT39jnf8hagQR7aLgmVPSA6AM4Jr/12.PNG)
 In this stage, Referring to 7493 IC, its CKA or clock input receives the pulse signal from the first stage or the timer circuit stage. 

### ***To breifly understand its pin configuration see table below***


##### 7493 (4-bit binary counter)

Pin|Symbol|Description
---------|---------|-------------
1|CKA|clock input, 2nd, 3rd and 4th section (high-to-low edge-triggered)
2	|R0 (1)	|asynchronous master reset
3	|R0 (2)	|asynchronous master reset
4	|NC	|no connection
5	|Vcc	|supply voltage
6	|NC	|no connection
7	|NC|	no connection
8	|QC	|counter output
9	|QB	|counter output
10	|GND	|ground
11	|QD|	counter output
12	|QA|counter output
13	|NC|	no connection
14	|CKB|	clock input, 1st section (high-to-low edge-triggered)

###  <center>  Third Stage </center>

The main component of the third stage is the 74154 Demultiplexer IC. The simple theory behind DEMUX  is just to decode four input signals (signals from 7493) into 16 output signals
This component is very important to produce many outputs from few input frequency signals and for us to make many combinations of led designs.

### Notes:
>‚ô¶ In wiring the circuit in the real world, make sure not to short the leads of LEDs and resistors because this could damage the Integrated Circuit (IC) permanently.
  

## Part II. Circuit Construction of the Running Lights in BreadBoard

‚ù∂ **Open the fritzing Software** - In this part I'm using other type of electronics software for testing components and circuits for Flexibility purposes üî•. Also, this procedure is for realistic testing of components  connected to each of them in the application of Running lights.

# Objective of this project

The main objective of this project is to learn how to design the schematic diagram of running lights circuit at the same time will teach and shows us how to used different softwares  in testing components. This tutorial post will also helps everyone maximize their ability make a project better than this and hopefully apply this project in the future. This project is not limited to this application only , thus it depends on your creativity and desires for the  innovations of our technology/technologies.

I hope that this will be helpful to everyone specially students and fan of Electronics ‚ù§Ô∏è
